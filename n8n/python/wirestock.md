## Wirestock

**Platform Overview and AI Policy**

Wirestock is an interesting platform because it acts as an aggregator. You upload your images to Wirestock, and they distribute them to other marketplaces like Adobe Stock, Freepik, and Dreamstime. This can save you a lot of time and effort. They are very friendly to AI-generated content and even have their own AI image generator.

**Upload Method**

Wirestock does not have a public API for contributor uploads. However, they offer several convenient upload methods:

*   **Web Interface:** A simple drag-and-drop interface.
*   **Cloud Storage:** Connect your Google Drive or Dropbox account for bulk uploads.
*   **Discord Bot:** If you use Discord-based AI image generators, you can use their bot to upload directly from Discord.

**Metadata Requirements**

One of the main advantages of Wirestock is that they handle the keywording and descriptions for you. You simply upload your images, and their team and AI will take care of the metadata.
